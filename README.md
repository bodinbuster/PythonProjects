## PythonProjects
Some example projects I have been working on over the years

# YouTube Video Downloader
- This simple Python program uses the PyTube library to let you download any Youtube video with a given link.
- It will then download this to the current directory (Folder) the file is in.
- You can change the default download folder in this line:
  ```Python
  ys.download('C:\\Users\\EXAMPLE\\Videos')
  ```
